# backbone-contacts
My first Backbone.js app

A very simple contacts app, displaying a list of contacts with name, email and phone.

Functionality:
* Add contact.
* Edit contact.
* Delete contact.
* Search contacts by name.

The UI still needs to be designed and doesnâ€™t look to pretty yet.

Not connected to a database yet.
